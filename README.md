# HABS
aka, historicly accurate battle simulator v0.1.0 (spesificly for my history project)

I made the most complex thing I could for my history project with the programing that I knew, features the latest copy and pasted capsules and cubes with a dash of googling code,
perfect



BUGS:
things shoot INCREADABLY fast
things are invincable
(they also have a lot of health, but that's because I havn't balanced anything)
things won't move
maybe more?
